# Mock API in Flutter (with Dio)

When building Flutter apps, sometimes the backend is still in progress or APIs may go down.  
Instead of pausing development, you can **mock API responses** and keep moving forward.  

This package demonstrates how to mock APIs in **Flutter** using the [`dio`](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) package and `MockInterceptor`.

## ✨ Features
- 🚀 Continue frontend development without waiting for backend
- 🛠️ Mock success, error, or empty responses
- 🔄 Switch between real and mock APIs easily
- ✅ Great for testing different UI states

---

## Demo
# Notice, how on a single line change, API hits real endpoint otherwise returns Mock data.
