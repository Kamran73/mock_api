# Mock API in Flutter (with Dio)

When building Flutter apps, sometimes the backend is still in progress or APIs may go down.  
Instead of pausing development, you can **mock API responses** and keep moving forward.  

This package demonstrates how to mock APIs in **Flutter** using the [`dio`](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) package and `MockInterceptor`.
